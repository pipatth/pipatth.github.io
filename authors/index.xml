      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a machine learning engineer at Data Revenue GmbH. I designed and developed end-to-end machine learning systems for medical researchers. I am also a founder of Dataginjo LLC where I worked with clients in online education and recreation industries to apply machine learning and predictive modeling in marketing and operation areas. My interests include reinforcement learning and time-series forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before moving to the U.S., I worked with VNET Venture Capital, one of the leading venture capital management companies in Thailand. My focus was on identifying investment opportunities in IT, retail, healthcare, and food industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I published research articles on Quantitative Finance and Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting. But now I am focusing on artificial intelligence in marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy beer, cooking, SCUBA diving, and looking at soccer stats&lt;/p&gt;
